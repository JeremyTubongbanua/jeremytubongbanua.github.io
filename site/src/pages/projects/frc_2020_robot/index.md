## Description

This was the last year of High school, where I implemented many autonomous features as the lead programmer of FRC 5596 in 2020.

Unfortunately, the robot was never able to compete due to COVID-19.

It was deemed a very competitive robot due to our [6 ball autonomous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA8CQsWH7rc) using things like vision processing with Limelight, motion profiling, and PID control.
