## About

This website is now deprecated, and is replaced by [jeremytubongbanua.github.io](https://jeremytubongbanua.github.io)

I got tired of paying the domain and server fees that I went with a free website hosting service - GitHub pages

This website was written in React and deployed on a virtual private server I owned on IONOS.

It used to be deployed on jeremymark.ca, which was a domain I used to own along with the VPS.
