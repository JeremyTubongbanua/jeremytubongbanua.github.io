## What is Split?

Using atSigns and the at_java Java SDK, we used the atProtocol to implement a rudimentary Distributed Systems application. This application simply split the image in partitions and sent them to different servers running atSigns. The images were sent/received using atSigns so they were fully encrypted. Then the images were grey scaled and sent back to the root.
