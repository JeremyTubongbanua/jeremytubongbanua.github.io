                    <h2>Software Engineer at Atsign</h2>
                    <p>I am a contracted Software Engineer at Atsign, a Silicon Valley startup based in San Jose, California. I began my journey with Atsign as an intern in June 2022 and have been contracted full-time ever since. In this role, I work across various domains, including Embedded Microcontroller Development (C/C++), Cryptography (C/C++), SDK Development (Java, C, C++, Python), DevOps (Bash, Docker, Linux). I also play a lead role in talent acquisition, as one of the lead recruiters for our annual summer internship for the past three years. Atsign is revolutionizing network security with its Networking 2.0 solutions, such as NoPorts, which enable secure remote access to devices without exposing any network attack surfaces.</p>

                    <h2>Incoming Software Engineering Graduate</h2>
                    <p>I am set to graduate in June 2025 from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Software Engineering. My career aspirations include securing a position in Software Engineering with a focus on C/C++, Embedded Development, Security, or AI/ML. Alternatively, I aim to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering to further deepen my expertise.</p>

                    <h2>FIRST Robotics: Coach, Judge Advisor, and Alumnus</h2>
                    <p>My engineering journey began as a programming mentee in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Today, I dedicate my time to inspiring elementary and high school students to develop a passion for STEM by serving as a coach and mentor. Additionally, I act as a Judge Advisor, leading adult judges each year in evaluating LEGO robots at our official annual FLL robotics tournament.</p>

                    <h2>Robotics & 3D Printing Hobbyist</h2>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy combining my expertise in software engineering with my hobbyist skills in 3D printing, mechanical design, and electrical engineering to build robots. I've been able to find many intersections with this hobby at work, such as an IoT water planting demo that was displayed at the largest tech show in the world, CES 2024. I own an X1 Carbon 3D printer with 2 AMS systems will a whole arsenal of modifications to it.</p>
